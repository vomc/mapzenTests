# mapzenTests
Running the Amman map style on heroku since MapZen is shutting down
https://mapzen.com/blog/migration/

From their docs

To run a map for a city or a region with no network dependencies:

Save `mapzen.js / tangram.js, index.html` and `scene.yaml` file in a directory.
Extract a pyramid of tiles for area of interest using tilepack and save them in that same directory. (Note you donâ€™t need to go beyond z15 tiles as they contain all the data in higher (>= 16) tiles, and Tangram overzooms.)
To download tiles from our hosted services before shutdown:

https://github.com/tilezen/tilepacks MAPZEN_API_KEY=mapzen-xxxxxx tilepack -122.51489 37.70808 -122.35698 37.83239 10 15 sf_mvt_10_15 --tile-size 512

Size and download speeds makes this viable for a city and perhaps a region. The example above generates a 30MB pyramid of MVT tiles, or 138MB of topojson, for San Francisco. For GeoJSON, SF is 67MB at z14, and 130MB at z15.

Serve tiles via a web server (localhost or hosted).
Create a scene file for Tangram. Note you will need to override the mapzen source in the scene file if you are importing a basemap.
sources:
    mapzen:
        type: MVT
        url:  localhost:8000/sf_mvt_10_15/all/{z}/{x}/{y}.mvt
        tile_size: 512
        max_zoom: 15
